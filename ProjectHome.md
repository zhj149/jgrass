<h1>Introducing JGrass</h1>

Welcome to the website for the Java Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (JGrass) Application. If you are reading this it is probably because you are exploring and checking out what other content is available.<br>
<br>
We currently use this space as a repository for JGrass documentation and articles, the development of online help, developer help, and the occasional batch of open source gis documentation.<br>
<br>
JGrass is a free, multi platform, open source GIS based on the GIS framework of uDig (that is why the intro looks so similar to that of <a href='http://udig.refractions.net/'>uDig</a>).<br>
<br>
JGrass exploits were possible in its engine the power of <a href='http://grass.osgeo.org/'>GRASS</a>.<br>
<br>

At the moment JGrass (or better its tools) is dedicatated mostly to hydrological and geomophological analyses. This is due to the fact that the main sponsors of the project are the <a href='http://www.unitn.it/dipartimenti/cudam'>CUDAM</a> and <a href='http://www.hydrologis.com/'>Hydrologis</a>. The involved University department makes JGrass a very complete piece of software to deal with environmental issues in the field of Hydrology and Morphology.<br>
<br>
<h1>Documentation</h1>

The project documentation is going to be rebuilt in this wiki. The entry point is <a href='MainDocumentation.md'>here</a>.<br>
<br>
<h1>The source code</h1>

The source code of JGrass is kept under distributed versioning system in the same umbrella repository as uDig at <a href='http://gitorious.org/udig/jgrass'>Gitorious</a>.<br>
