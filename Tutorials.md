To get started with JGrass, from the install through to the hydro-geomorphological processing, have a look at this presentation:

[Introduction to JGrass](http://www.slideshare.net/SlidesAboutHydrology/4-introduction-to-jgrass)


To have an overview on JGrass and the related frameworks, have a look at the following posters:

[JGrass, a System which copes with hydrology and geomorphology](http://www.slideshare.net/posterVienna/jgrass-and-hydrology)

[Not anymore without a GIS](http://www.slideshare.net/posterVienna/not-anymore-without-a-gis-jgrass)
